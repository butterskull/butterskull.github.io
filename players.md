One misty morning long ago, a sullen elven ranger known only by the name of [Gabranth](players.md#gabranth) emerged silently from the forest's edge and approached [Phandalin](locations.md#phandalin). It was the first town he'd visited in near a tenday. Normally he preferred the comfort of the wilderness and avoided urban affairs, but his search for a rumored dragon had run cold and he needed a lead. Besides, this modest town was hardly the big city that [Neverwinter](locations.md#neverwinter) was. He focused on his intended mission, passed several shuttered buildings on the oddly empty street, and approached the town's only inn.

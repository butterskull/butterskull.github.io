**Backstory**  
TK Crumback grew up in a small village, leaving at age 19 to study as an acolyte in the light domain. After completing his studies, he was struck by wanderlust and took to the road as a traveling holy man. He spent nearly a decade in the woods, befriending a forest gnome Druid called Dimble who taught him the Druidic language. Eventually he left for the coast, where he joined the crew of a ship as its spiritual leader. He’s recently disembarked to return to a life of rambling adventure.

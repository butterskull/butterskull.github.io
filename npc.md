## Linene Graywind
### Proprietor of the Lionshield Coster
##### You need it, we got it at the Coster.

**Description**  
The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. Linene has a few scruples, however, and won’t sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.

## Luck
### Magnificent Magical Horse
##### With Luck, we'll make it by sundown.

**Description**  
> The horse's coat was a glistening black and its deep dark eyes were decorated with eyelashes so long that the perceptive among us noticed them before almost anything else. A flowing mane draped leisurely over the horse's thick neck and its matching tail hung almost to the ground. Ornately embroidered in silky green thread on the side of his well-oiled pitch black saddle was a single word in cursive, Luck. Luck's reins and bridle were clearly expertly crafted in black leather with shiny green powder-coated iron linkages. Adorning the saddle on each side were four emerald inlaid four-leaf clovers about two inches in diameter. Even Luck's shoes were customized with four-leaf clovers that left a distinct footprint behind him when he walked.

## Doberan Flank
### Leader of the Stonefrost Reavers
##### Oi, halfling, buy me a beer!

**Description**  
Looks pretty strong, but reported to be clumsy when drunk.

## Harbin Wester
### Townmaster of Phandalin
##### If you're a dragon, know that I'm far too thin and bony to make a good meal!

**Description**  
All the notices on the job board are written by Harbin Wester, Phandalin’s duly appointed townmaster. Harbin is a pompous, middle-aged banker who lives in a house east of the townmaster’s hall. Reports of a white dragon in the area have turned him into a veritable shut-in, and he rarely goes outside except to get food and post new notices calling for adventurers.

## Dazlyn Grayshard
### Mining and Excavation
##### I'll give you 50 gold fer it, take it er leave it.

**Description**  
Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune are shield dwarf prospectors and business partners. While looking for gold in the mountains southwest of Phandalin, they decided to explore a nearby canyon and found evidence of an ancient dwarven settlement buried by an avalanche. They’ve spent the past several months clearing the rubble and scouring the ruins for treasure, but have found nothing of value so far. Dazlyn is forthright and honest to a fault.

## Norbus Ironrune
### Mining and Excavation
##### Hrmph...

**Description**  
Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune are shield dwarf prospectors and business partners. While looking for gold in the mountains southwest of Phandalin, they decided to explore a nearby canyon and found evidence of an ancient dwarven settlement buried by an avalanche. They’ve spent the past several months clearing the rubble and scouring the ruins for treasure, but have found nothing of value so far. Norbus is gruff and excessively cautious. He banters with Dazlyn like an old married couple.

## Fenryl
### Loyal Mascot of the Stonehill Inn
##### Ruff!

**Description**  
Fenryl is the ghostly grey dog that can frequently be seen lazing about the Stonehill Inn.

## Toblen Stonehill
### Innkeeper of the Stonehill Inn
##### Welcome to Phandalin, can I get you a mug?

**Description**  
The proprietor of the Stonehill Inn is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.
